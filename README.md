This was my first real production app. Glitzher was created to help cosmetic consumers find the best price's on cosmetic products from different brands. 

Glitzher can be found here: https://glitzher.com & the blog can be found at https://glitzher.com/blog (If not found the site has been taken offline).

# How it works #
This is a price comparison website. Cosmetic products from all the major Canadian retailers were scraped into Redis and Algolia. Redis was used as the database for this project as well as the caching layer. Algolia was used for product instant search. The web scrapers were hosted on the digital ocean server and would scrape the data right before the redis cache expired. This ensured that all product prices were kept up to date.
