This was my first real production app. Glitzher was created to help cosmetic consumers find the best price's on cosmetic products from different brands. There are 2 parts to this app, they can be found in "branches". The first is the main website and the second is a blog extension which was made with NextJS and Sanity.io

Glitzher can be found here: https://glitzher.com & the blog can be found at https://glitzher.com/blog (If not found the site has been taken offline).
